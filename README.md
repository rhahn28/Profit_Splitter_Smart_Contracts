## DeferredEquityPlan

In this contract, we will be managing an employee's "deferred equity incentive plan" in which 1000 shares will be distributed over 4 years to the employee. We won't need to work with Ether in this contract, but we will be storing and setting amounts that represent the number of distributed shares the employee owns and enforcing the vetting periods automatically.
